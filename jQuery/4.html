					<h1>The Hound of the Baskervilles</h1>
					<p>Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon
					his knee. &ldquo;You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the
					long s and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me
					to fix the date.&rdquo; At the head was written: &ldquo;;Baskerville
					Hall,&rdquo; and below in large, scrawling figures: &ldquo;;1742.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>&ldquo;;It appears to be a statement of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>&ldquo;;Yes&mdash;it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the
					Baskerville family.&rdquo;</p>
					<blockquote>
					<q>Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many
					statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and
					as I had the story from my father&hellip;</q>
					</blockquote>
					<p>When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
					his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock
					Holmes.</p>
